		Code Challenge:

		Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, please recreate the small blog application seen in the image below.
		And think about how to integrate Advertise with the blog application for best user experience and Ads performance.
		If needed, feel free to use Google for help. Please give your best effort without looking at other code
		examples. The primary goal of this challenge is to get an understanding of your level of comfort with
		CSS and JS. We don't expect it to be perfect but, please be prepared to explain your solution.

		Blog App: http://i.imgur.com/xbSRpUk.png (blog-app-homepage.png)
		
		-The app should be fully responsive up to a maximum width of 1200 pixels.
		-The articles images should always maintain the proper aspect ratio of 16 x 9 even though the original
		 (source) image might not have the correct aspect radio.
		-Use any tools or libraries you feel comfortable with.		
		
		
		Adding a New Article: 
		
		On Add New: http://i.imgur.com/kQ2UjiL.png (blog-app-add-new.png)

		a new orticle to the list. In this modal window, the user can enter an image source, an article title, and
		article content.
		
		After a user clicks the "Save" button, the modal should disappear, and the new article should be added to
		the top of the list of articles.

		the article title, and the article content. 
		
		After a user clicks the "Save" button, the modal window should disappear and the updated content should be
